1. Start Test:

   ```http
   POST /api/tests/executions/{executionId}/start
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

   - Changes status to 'IN_PROGRESS'
   - Sets started_at timestamp

2. Submit Answers:

   ```http
   POST /api/tests/executions/{executionId}/submitAllAnswers
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "endTime": timestamp,
     "responses": [
       {"questionId": number, "answer": string, "timeTaken": number},
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```

   - Requires 'IN_PROGRESS' status
   - Returns 400 if test not started

#### Implementation Status

- Start endpoint: Implemented correctly
- Submit endpoint: Validation working as expected
- Error handling: User-friendly messages

#### Next Steps

1. Frontend should call start endpoint when "Start Test" button is clicked
2. Only enable answer submission after test is started
3. Handle error responses appropriately in the UI

### Test Start Endpoint Issue (2024-12-13 09:43:48Z)

#### Current Issue

Frontend is making GET request to start endpoint, but endpoint is defined as POST:

```
GET /api/tests/executions/78/start (404 Not Found)
```

#### Expected Request

```http
POST /api/tests/executions/78/start
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

#### Frontend Changes Needed

1. Update the start test request to use POST method
2. Example fetch call:
   ```javascript
   fetch("/api/tests/executions/78/start", {
     method: "POST",
     headers: {
       Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
       "Content-Type": "application/json",
     },
   });
   ```

#### Alternative Solutions

1. Keep POST endpoint and update frontend (Recommended)

   - Follows REST conventions
   - Maintains state-changing semantics
   - Already implemented and tested

2. Add GET endpoint (Not Recommended)
   - Would break REST conventions
   - State changes should use POST
   - Would need duplicate validation logic

#### Next Steps

1. Update frontend code to use POST method
2. Ensure proper error handling for failed requests
3. Add loading state during request
