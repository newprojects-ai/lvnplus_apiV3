### Question Distribution Implementation (2024-12-10)

#### What

- Creating a separate utility for question distribution across difficulty levels
- Moving the distribution logic out of the test plan creation flow
- Maintaining the existing test plan creation functionality

#### Why

- To make the difficulty level distribution configurable
- To separate concerns and improve maintainability
- To allow for future modifications to distribution logic without affecting core functionality

#### How

1. Create a new utility file for question distribution
2. Implement the current distribution logic:
   - Equal distribution across levels 1-5
   - Floor division for base distribution
   - Remainder questions go to lower levels
3. Keep the existing test plan creation flow intact
4. Only modify the question count generation

#### Implementation Details

- Location: `src/utils/questionDistribution.ts`
- Current Logic:
  ```typescript
  Example: 13 questions total
  - Base: floor(13/5) = 2 per level
  - Remainder: 13 % 5 = 3
  - Distribution: {1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 2}
  ```

#### Testing Notes

- Verify test plan creation still works
- Confirm question counts sum equals total requested
- Check distribution across difficulty levels

#### Utility Overview

- Created `src/utils/questionDistribution.ts`
- Implemented flexible question distribution mechanism
- Supports configurable difficulty levels (1-5)

#### Key Functions

1. `distributeQuestions(totalQuestions, levels)`

   - Distributes questions across specified difficulty levels
   - Default is 3 levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
   - Handles remainders by adding to initial levels
   - Validates input and ensures distribution is within 1-5 levels

2. `validateQuestionDistribution(distribution)`
   - Validates the generated question distribution
   - Ensures all levels are between 1-5
   - Checks that total questions match the input

#### Distribution Strategy

- Uses floor division for base distribution
- Adds remainder questions to initial levels
- Supports dynamic level count (1-5)

#### Example Distributions

```typescript
distributeQuestions(13); // { 1: 5, 2: 4, 3: 4 }
distributeQuestions(10, 5); // { 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 2 }
```

  if (value === undefined) {
    return defaultValue;
  }

  try {
    if (typeof value === 'string' && value.trim() === '') {
      throw new Error('Empty string is not a valid BigInt');
    }

    const result = typeof value === 'string' ? BigInt(value) : value;

    if (result === BigInt(0) && value !== '0' && value !== 0n) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid BigInt value: ${value}`);
    }

    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new ValidationError(`Invalid execution ID: ${value}`);
  }
}

// Updated controller validation
if (!id || isNaN(Number(id))) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid execution ID provided' });
}
```

#### Rationale

- Prevent silent failures in BigInt conversion
- Provide better error messages for debugging

- Tracks when tests are started

#### Technical Details

- Route: POST `/tests/executions/{executionId}/start`
- Authentication: Required
- Status Transition: NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS
- Timestamp: Sets `started_at` to current time
- Error Cases:
  - 400: Invalid execution ID
  - 401: Unauthorized (missing user ID)
  - 404: Execution not found
  - 400: Test already started

### Test Execution Status Validation (2024-12-13 09:12:50Z)

#### What

- Modified status validation in `submitAllAnswers` method to strictly require 'IN_PROGRESS' status
- Updated error message to be more user-friendly and instructive

#### Why

- Enforce proper test flow where users must explicitly start the test before submitting answers
- Prevent submission of answers for tests that haven't been started
- Provide clear guidance to users when they attempt to submit answers before starting the test

#### How

1. Updated validation logic in `execution.service.ts`
2. Enhanced error message to instruct users to click "Start Test" button
3. Maintained detailed error logging for debugging purposes

#### Changes Made

```typescript
// Previous error message
throw new ValidationError(
  `Cannot submit answers. Current status is ${
    execution.status
  }. Allowed statuses are: ${allowedStatuses.join(", ")}`
);

// Updated to more user-friendly message
throw new ValidationError(
  'Cannot submit answers. Test must be started first. Please click "Start Test" before submitting answers.'
);
```

### Test Start Integration (2024-12-13 09:28:39Z)

#### What

Documented the integration between test start endpoint and answer submission validation:

1. Start Test Flow:

   - Endpoint: POST `/tests/executions/{executionId}/start`
   - Changes status from 'NOT_STARTED' to 'IN_PROGRESS'
   - Sets started_at timestamp

2. Answer Submission Flow:
   - Requires test to be in 'IN_PROGRESS' status
   - Returns user-friendly error if test not started
   - Guides user to use "Start Test" button

#### Integration Points

1. Start Test Endpoint:

   ```typescript
   router.post(
     "/tests/executions/:executionId/start",
     authenticate,
     startExecution
   );
   ```

2. Status Validation in Answer Submission:
   ```typescript
   if (execution.status !== "IN_PROGRESS") {
     throw new ValidationError(
       'Cannot submit answers. Test must be started first. Please click "Start Test" before submitting answers.'
     );
   }
   ```

#### Flow

1. User clicks "Start Test" button
2. Frontend calls start endpoint
3. Backend validates and updates status
4. User can then submit answers
5. Answer submission validates 'IN_PROGRESS' status

### Test Execution Flow Update (2024-12-13 09:39:52Z)

#### Current Issue

Error when submitting answers: Test execution (ID: 78) is in 'NOT_STARTED' status

#### Required Flow

1. Start Test:

   ```http
   POST /api/tests/executions/{executionId}/start
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

   - Changes status to 'IN_PROGRESS'
   - Sets started_at timestamp

2. Submit Answers:

   ```http
   POST /api/tests/executions/{executionId}/submitAllAnswers
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "endTime": timestamp,
     "responses": [
       {"questionId": number, "answer": string, "timeTaken": number},
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```

   - Requires 'IN_PROGRESS' status
   - Returns 400 if test not started

#### Implementation Status

- Start endpoint: Implemented correctly
- Submit endpoint: Validation working as expected
- Error handling: User-friendly messages

#### Next Steps

1. Frontend should call start endpoint when "Start Test" button is clicked
2. Only enable answer submission after test is started
3. Handle error responses appropriately in the UI

### Test Start Endpoint Issue (2024-12-13 09:43:48Z)

#### Current Issue

Frontend is making GET request to start endpoint, but endpoint is defined as POST:

```
GET /api/tests/executions/78/start (404 Not Found)
```

#### Expected Request

```http
POST /api/tests/executions/78/start
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

#### Frontend Changes Needed

1. Update the start test request to use POST method
2. Example fetch call:
   ```javascript
   fetch("/api/tests/executions/78/start", {
     method: "POST",
     headers: {
       Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
       "Content-Type": "application/json",
     },
   });
   ```

#### Alternative Solutions

1. Keep POST endpoint and update frontend (Recommended)

   - Follows REST conventions
   - Maintains state-changing semantics
   - Already implemented and tested

2. Add GET endpoint (Not Recommended)
   - Would break REST conventions
   - State changes should use POST
   - Would need duplicate validation logic

#### Next Steps

1. Update frontend code to use POST method
2. Ensure proper error handling for failed requests
3. Add loading state during request

### Gamification System Implementation Update (2025-01-10T12:43:04Z)

   - Tracks total questions attempted and correct answers per subject
   - Calculates mastery level (0-5) based on accuracy:
     - Level 0: Beginner (0-20% accuracy)
     - Level 1: Novice (21-40% accuracy)
     - Level 2: Intermediate (41-60% accuracy)
     - Level 3: Advanced (61-80% accuracy)
     - Level 4: Expert (81-95% accuracy)
     - Level 5: Master (96-100% accuracy)
   - Awards XP for mastery level increases (100 XP per level)
   - Endpoint: POST `/api/gamification/subject-mastery`

2. **Activity Logging System**
   - Added activity logging functionality with pagination
   - Tracks all user activities with XP gains
   - Stores detailed activity information including:
     - Activity type
     - XP earned
     - Timestamp
     - Additional details in JSON format
   - Endpoints:
     - GET `/api/gamification/activity` - View activity log
     - POST `/api/gamification/activity` - Log new activity

3. **Integration Points**

### Gamification Integration with Test Execution (2024-01-09)

#### Changes Made

1. Updated `execution.service.ts` to integrate gamification features:
   - Added `GamificationService` integration for tracking subject mastery and activity logging
   - Implemented XP rewards for:
     - Answer submissions (10 XP for correct answers)
     - Test completion (10 XP per score point)
   - Added activity logging for:
     - Test starts
     - Answer submissions
     - Test completions
   - Integrated subject mastery updates based on exam board subjects

2. Gamification Events Added:
   - `TEST_START`: Logged when a test execution is created
   - `ANSWER_SUBMISSION`: Logged for each answer submission with correctness
   - `TEST_COMPLETION`: Logged when a test is completed with final score

#### Rationale

- Integrating gamification directly into the test execution flow ensures immediate feedback and rewards
- XP rewards are scaled based on performance to encourage better results
- Subject mastery tracking helps identify areas of strength and improvement
- Activity logging provides detailed insights into user engagement and progress

#### Next Steps

- Monitor XP distribution and adjust reward values if needed
- Add achievement triggers based on test completion milestones
- Implement leaderboard integration with test scores
- Consider adding bonus XP for streaks of correct answers

### Gamification Service Improvements (2025-01-21 17:13:34Z)

#### Issue
- Student progress records were not being automatically created
- Test completion was failing when student progress didn't exist
- Lack of graceful handling for missing progress records

#### Changes Made

1. Enhanced GamificationService with Auto-initialization
   - Added `initializeStudentProgress` method to create missing records
   - Validates user existence and student role before creation
   - Sets default values for new progress records

2. Modified Progress Record Handling
   ```typescript
   // Progress initialization in getProgress
   if (!progress) {
     const newProgress = await this.initializeStudentProgress(userId);
     return this.formatProgressResponse(newProgress);
   }

   // Progress initialization in addXP
   if (!progress) {
     progress = await this.initializeStudentProgress(userId);
   }
   ```

3. Added Progress Response Formatting
   - Created `formatProgressResponse` method for consistent response structure
   - Handles null/undefined subject mastery gracefully
   - Ensures type safety in response formatting

#### Technical Details

1. Initial Progress Values:
   - Level: 1
   - Current XP: 0
   - Next Level XP: 1000
   - Streak Days: 0
   - Total Points: 0

2. Validation Checks:
   - Verifies user exists before creating progress
   - Confirms user has STUDENT role
   - Handles edge cases and errors gracefully

3. Error Handling:
   - Detailed error logging for initialization failures
   - Proper error propagation with specific error types
   - Maintains existing error handling patterns

#### Impact
- Eliminates "Student progress not found" errors
- Improves user experience by auto-creating progress records
- Maintains data consistency across the gamification system

#### Next Steps
- Monitor error logs for initialization-related issues
- Consider adding progress record validation in other gamification operations
- Add metrics tracking for auto-initialized progress records

### Role Case Sensitivity Fix in Gamification Service (2025-01-21 17:42:12Z)

#### Issue
- ValidationError: "User is not a student" when completing tests
- Role check failing due to case sensitivity ('STUDENT' vs 'Student')
- Inconsistency between UI and API role name casing

#### Fix Applied
- Modified role checking in GamificationService to be case insensitive
- Updated `initializeStudentProgress` method to use uppercase comparison
- Ensures consistent role checking regardless of database role name casing

#### Technical Details
```typescript
// Before
const isStudent = user.user_roles.some(ur => ur.roles.role_name === 'STUDENT');

// After
const isStudent = user.user_roles.some(ur => 
  ur.roles.role_name.toUpperCase() === 'STUDENT'
);
```

#### Impact
- Fixes student progress initialization for users with 'Student' role
- Maintains compatibility with existing role names in database
- Prevents case sensitivity issues in role checking

#### Next Steps
- Consider standardizing role name casing across the application
- Add role name validation at database level
- Update other role checks to use case-insensitive comparison

### Prisma Schema Alignment Fix in GamificationService (2025-01-21 17:47:20Z)

#### Issue
- PrismaClientValidationError when creating student progress
- Error caused by attempting to include `subject_mastery` relation that wasn't defined in schema
- Mismatch between service code and database schema

#### Fix Applied
- Removed `subject_mastery` from Prisma include statements
- Updated progress response formatting to handle subject mastery separately
- Simplified student progress creation

#### Technical Details
```typescript
// Before - Invalid include
return await prisma.student_progress.create({
  data: { ... },
  include: {
    subject_mastery: true  // This caused the error
  }
});

// After - Correct schema alignment
return await prisma.student_progress.create({
  data: { ... }
});
```

#### Impact
- Fixes student progress creation during test completion
- Maintains data consistency with database schema
- Separates subject mastery concerns for future implementation

#### Next Steps
- Consider implementing subject mastery as a separate service
- Add proper schema relations if subject mastery tracking is needed
- Update other services that might depend on subject mastery data

### Parent/Tutor Features Implementation - Phase 1 (2025-01-23 15:15:43Z)
