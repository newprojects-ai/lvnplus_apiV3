### Question Distribution Implementation (2024-12-10)

#### What

- Creating a separate utility for question distribution across difficulty levels
- Moving the distribution logic out of the test plan creation flow
- Maintaining the existing test plan creation functionality

#### Why

- To make the difficulty level distribution configurable
- To separate concerns and improve maintainability
- To allow for future modifications to distribution logic without affecting core functionality

#### How

1. Create a new utility file for question distribution
2. Implement the current distribution logic:
   - Equal distribution across levels 1-5
   - Floor division for base distribution
   - Remainder questions go to lower levels
3. Keep the existing test plan creation flow intact
4. Only modify the question count generation

#### Implementation Details

- Location: `src/utils/questionDistribution.ts`
- Current Logic:
  ```typescript
  Example: 13 questions total
  - Base: floor(13/5) = 2 per level
  - Remainder: 13 % 5 = 3
  - Distribution: {1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 2}
  ```

#### Testing Notes

- Verify test plan creation still works
- Confirm question counts sum equals total requested
- Check distribution across difficulty levels

### Question Distribution Utility Implementation (2024-12-11)

#### Utility Overview

- Created `src/utils/questionDistribution.ts`
- Implemented flexible question distribution mechanism
- Supports configurable difficulty levels (1-5)

#### Key Functions

1. `distributeQuestions(totalQuestions, levels)`

   - Distributes questions across specified difficulty levels
   - Default is 3 levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
   - Handles remainders by adding to initial levels
   - Validates input and ensures distribution is within 1-5 levels

2. `validateQuestionDistribution(distribution)`
   - Validates the generated question distribution
   - Ensures all levels are between 1-5
   - Checks that total questions match the input

#### Distribution Strategy

- Uses floor division for base distribution
- Adds remainder questions to initial levels
- Supports dynamic level count (1-5)

#### Example Distributions

```typescript
distributeQuestions(13); // { 1: 5, 2: 4, 3: 4 }
distributeQuestions(10, 5); // { 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 2 }
```

#### Benefits

   - Now throws ValidationError instead of returning default value

2. **Execution Controller Improvements**
   - Added validation for execution ID format
   - Improved error messages for missing user ID
   - Removed default '0' value for missing user ID

#### Implementation Details

```typescript
// Updated safeBigInt implementation
private safeBigInt(value: bigint | string | undefined, defaultValue: bigint = BigInt(0)): bigint {
  if (value === undefined) {
    return defaultValue;
  }

  try {
    if (typeof value === 'string' && value.trim() === '') {
      throw new Error('Empty string is not a valid BigInt');
    }

    const result = typeof value === 'string' ? BigInt(value) : value;

    if (result === BigInt(0) && value !== '0' && value !== 0n) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid BigInt value: ${value}`);
    }

    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new ValidationError(`Invalid execution ID: ${value}`);
  }
}

// Updated controller validation
if (!id || isNaN(Number(id))) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid execution ID provided' });
}
```

#### Rationale

- Prevent silent failures in BigInt conversion
- Provide better error messages for debugging
- Improve input validation at controller level

#### Benefits

- More reliable execution ID handling
- Better error messages for debugging
- Improved validation at multiple levels

#### Next Steps
- Monitor error logs for any new patterns

- Ensures proper test execution flow
- Tracks when tests are started

#### Technical Details

- Route: POST `/tests/executions/{executionId}/start`
- Authentication: Required
- Status Transition: NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS
- Timestamp: Sets `started_at` to current time
- Error Cases:
  - 400: Invalid execution ID
  - 401: Unauthorized (missing user ID)
  - 404: Execution not found
  - 400: Test already started

### Test Execution Status Validation (2024-12-13 09:12:50Z)

#### What

- Modified status validation in `submitAllAnswers` method to strictly require 'IN_PROGRESS' status
- Updated error message to be more user-friendly and instructive

#### Why

- Enforce proper test flow where users must explicitly start the test before submitting answers
- Prevent submission of answers for tests that haven't been started
- Provide clear guidance to users when they attempt to submit answers before starting the test

#### How

1. Updated validation logic in `execution.service.ts`
2. Enhanced error message to instruct users to click "Start Test" button
3. Maintained detailed error logging for debugging purposes

#### Changes Made

```typescript
// Previous error message
throw new ValidationError(
  `Cannot submit answers. Current status is ${
    execution.status
  }. Allowed statuses are: ${allowedStatuses.join(", ")}`
);

// Updated to more user-friendly message
throw new ValidationError(
  'Cannot submit answers. Test must be started first. Please click "Start Test" before submitting answers.'
);
```

### Test Start Integration (2024-12-13 09:28:39Z)

#### What

Documented the integration between test start endpoint and answer submission validation:

1. Start Test Flow:

   - Endpoint: POST `/tests/executions/{executionId}/start`
   - Changes status from 'NOT_STARTED' to 'IN_PROGRESS'
   - Sets started_at timestamp

2. Answer Submission Flow:
   - Requires test to be in 'IN_PROGRESS' status
   - Returns user-friendly error if test not started
   - Guides user to use "Start Test" button

#### Integration Points

1. Start Test Endpoint:

   ```typescript
   router.post(
     "/tests/executions/:executionId/start",
     authenticate,
     startExecution
   );
   ```

2. Status Validation in Answer Submission:
   ```typescript
   if (execution.status !== "IN_PROGRESS") {
     throw new ValidationError(
       'Cannot submit answers. Test must be started first. Please click "Start Test" before submitting answers.'
     );
   }
   ```

#### Flow

1. User clicks "Start Test" button
2. Frontend calls start endpoint
3. Backend validates and updates status
4. User can then submit answers
5. Answer submission validates 'IN_PROGRESS' status

### Test Execution Flow Update (2024-12-13 09:39:52Z)

#### Current Issue

Error when submitting answers: Test execution (ID: 78) is in 'NOT_STARTED' status

#### Required Flow

1. Start Test:

   ```http
   POST /api/tests/executions/{executionId}/start
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

   - Changes status to 'IN_PROGRESS'
   - Sets started_at timestamp

2. Submit Answers:

   ```http
   POST /api/tests/executions/{executionId}/submitAllAnswers
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "endTime": timestamp,
     "responses": [
       {"questionId": number, "answer": string, "timeTaken": number},
       ...
     ]
   }
   ```

   - Requires 'IN_PROGRESS' status
   - Returns 400 if test not started

#### Implementation Status

- Start endpoint: Implemented correctly
- Submit endpoint: Validation working as expected
- Error handling: User-friendly messages

#### Next Steps
1. Frontend should call start endpoint when "Start Test" button is clicked
2. Only enable answer submission after test is started
3. Handle error responses appropriately in the UI

### Test Start Endpoint Issue (2024-12-13 09:43:48Z)

#### Current Issue

Frontend is making GET request to start endpoint, but endpoint is defined as POST:

```
GET /api/tests/executions/78/start (404 Not Found)
```

#### Expected Request

```http
POST /api/tests/executions/78/start
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

#### Frontend Changes Needed

1. Update the start test request to use POST method
2. Example fetch call:
   ```javascript
   fetch("/api/tests/executions/78/start", {
     method: "POST",
     headers: {
       Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
       "Content-Type": "application/json",
     },
   });
   ```

#### Alternative Solutions

1. Keep POST endpoint and update frontend (Recommended)

   - Follows REST conventions
   - Maintains state-changing semantics
   - Already implemented and tested

2. Add GET endpoint (Not Recommended)
   - Would break REST conventions
   - State changes should use POST
   - Would need duplicate validation logic

#### Next Steps

1. Update frontend code to use POST method
2. Ensure proper error handling for failed requests
3. Add loading state during request

### Gamification System Implementation Update (2025-01-10T12:43:04Z)

### Gamification Service Improvements (2025-01-21 17:13:34Z)

#### Issue
- Student progress records were not being automatically created
- Test completion was failing when student progress didn't exist
- Lack of graceful handling for missing progress records

#### Changes Made

1. Enhanced GamificationService with Auto-initialization
   - Added `initializeStudentProgress` method to create missing records
   - Validates user existence and student role before creation
   - Sets default values for new progress records

2. Modified Progress Record Handling
   ```typescript
   // Progress initialization in getProgress
   if (!progress) {
     const newProgress = await this.initializeStudentProgress(userId);
     return this.formatProgressResponse(newProgress);
   }

   // Progress initialization in addXP
   if (!progress) {
     progress = await this.initializeStudentProgress(userId);
   }
   ```

3. Added Progress Response Formatting
   - Created `formatProgressResponse` method for consistent response structure
   - Handles null/undefined subject mastery gracefully
   - Ensures type safety in response formatting

#### Technical Details

1. Initial Progress Values:
   - Level: 1
   - Current XP: 0
   - Next Level XP: 1000
   - Streak Days: 0
   - Total Points: 0

2. Validation Checks:
   - Verifies user exists before creating progress
   - Confirms user has STUDENT role
   - Handles edge cases and errors gracefully

3. Error Handling:
   - Detailed error logging for initialization failures
   - Proper error propagation with specific error types
   - Maintains existing error handling patterns

#### Impact
- Eliminates "Student progress not found" errors
- Improves user experience by auto-creating progress records
- Maintains data consistency across the gamification system

#### Next Steps
1. Monitor error logs for initialization-related issues
2. Consider adding progress record validation in other gamification operations
3. Add metrics tracking for auto-initialized progress records

### Role Case Sensitivity Fix in Gamification Service (2025-01-21 17:42:12Z)

#### Issue
- ValidationError: "User is not a student" when completing tests
- Role check failing due to case sensitivity ('STUDENT' vs 'Student')
- Inconsistency between UI and API role name casing

#### Fix Applied
- Modified role checking in GamificationService to be case insensitive
- Updated `initializeStudentProgress` method to use uppercase comparison
- Ensures consistent role checking regardless of database role name casing

#### Technical Details
```typescript
// Before
const isStudent = user.user_roles.some(ur => ur.roles.role_name === 'STUDENT');

// After
const isStudent = user.user_roles.some(ur => 
  ur.roles.role_name.toUpperCase() === 'STUDENT'
);
```

#### Impact
- Fixes student progress initialization for users with 'Student' role
- Maintains compatibility with existing role names in database
- Prevents case sensitivity issues in role checking

#### Next Steps
1. Consider standardizing role name casing across the application
2. Add role name validation at database level
3. Update other role checks to use case-insensitive comparison

### Prisma Schema Alignment Fix in GamificationService (2025-01-21 17:47:20Z)

#### Issue
- PrismaClientValidationError when creating student progress
- Error caused by attempting to include `subject_mastery` relation that wasn't defined in schema
- Mismatch between service code and database schema

#### Fix Applied
- Removed `subject_mastery` from Prisma include statements
- Updated progress response formatting to handle subject mastery separately
- Simplified student progress creation

#### Technical Details
```typescript
// Before - Invalid include
return await prisma.student_progress.create({
  data: { ... },
  include: {
    subject_mastery: true  // This caused the error
  }
});

// After - Correct schema alignment
return await prisma.student_progress.create({
  data: { ... }
});
```

#### Impact
- Fixes student progress creation during test completion
- Maintains data consistency with database schema
- Separates subject mastery concerns for future implementation

#### Next Steps
1. Consider implementing subject mastery as a separate service
2. Add proper schema relations if subject mastery tracking is needed
3. Update other services that might depend on subject mastery data

### 2025-02-13 18:10:51Z - Fixed Login Role Validation

#### What
- Updated login validation schema to properly validate user roles
- Added strict role validation using Zod enum

#### Why
- Users were encountering errors when trying to login with Student or Parent roles
- Previous validation only checked if role was a non-empty string
- No validation against allowed role types

#### How
1. Modified `validation.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const loginSchema = z.object({
     email: z.string().email(),
     password: z.string().min(1),
     role: z.enum(['ADMIN', 'STUDENT', 'PARENT', 'GUARDIAN', 'TUTOR'])
           .transform(val => val.toUpperCase()),
   });
   ```

#### Impact
- Improved error messages for invalid role attempts
- Prevents login attempts with non-existent roles
- Maintains consistent role casing through uppercase transformation

   - `DELETE /api/guardians/{guardianId}/students/{studentId}`: Remove relationship
   - `POST /api/students/confirm-guardian/{linkId}`: Confirm/reject guardian link

2. Tutor Endpoints:
   - `POST /api/tutors/students/link-request`: Request to link with a student
   - `DELETE /api/tutors/{tutorId}/students/{studentId}`: Remove relationship
   - `POST /api/students/confirm-tutor/{linkId}`: Confirm/reject tutor link

#### Implementation Details

   - Added required fields specification
   - Updated relationship enum to only include "PARENT"
   - Added descriptive examples
   - Removed incorrect bigint format from studentId

#### Request Body Format
```json
{
  "studentId": "string",
  "relationship": "PARENT"
}

```

### Guardian-Student Relationship Documentation Update (2025-02-13 11:28:39Z)

#### Changes Made
1. Enhanced Swagger documentation for `/api/guardians/link-request` endpoint:
   - Clarified both sides of the relationship:
     * Guardian: Identified by JWT token in Authorization header
     * Student: Identified by studentId in request body
   - Added detailed response schema showing:
     * linkId: Unique identifier for the link request
     * guardianId: ID of the requesting guardian
     * studentId: ID of the target student
     * status: Initial status (PENDING)
   - Added more descriptive error responses
   - Improved endpoint description to clearly show relationship flow

#### Relationship Flow
1. Guardian (authenticated via JWT) initiates link request
2. System creates a PENDING link request
3. Student must confirm the relationship (via separate endpoint)
4. Once confirmed, the parent-student relationship is established

#### Request Authentication
```
Authorization: Bearer <guardian_jwt_token>
```

#### Request Body
```json
{
  "studentId": "string",    // ID of the student to link with
  "relationship": "PARENT"  // Type of relationship (guardian's role)
}
```

#### Response Body
```json
{
  "linkId": "string",      // Unique ID for the link request
  "guardianId": "string",  // ID of the requesting guardian
  "studentId": "string",   // ID of the target student
  "status": "PENDING"      // Initial status of the request
}
```

### Admin Relationship Management Endpoints Added (2025-02-13 11:32:16Z)

#### Changes Made
1. Created new admin routes file with three endpoints:
   - `/api/admin/link/guardian-student`: Link a guardian with a student
   - `/api/admin/link/tutor-student`: Link a tutor with a student
   - `/api/admin/link/tutor-students/bulk`: Bulk link a tutor with multiple students

2. Added validation schemas in `admin.validation.ts`:
   - Schema for guardian-student links
   - Schema for tutor-student links
   - Schema for bulk tutor-student links

#### Guardian-Student Link
```json
POST /api/admin/link/guardian-student
{
  "guardianId": "string",
  "studentId": "string",
  "relationship": "PARENT"
}
```

#### Tutor-Student Link
```json
POST /api/admin/link/tutor-student
{
  "tutorId": "string",
  "studentId": "string",

}
```

#### Bulk Tutor-Student Link
```json
POST /api/admin/link/tutor-students/bulk
{
  "tutorId": "string",
  "students": [
    {
      "studentId": "string",
      "subjects": ["MATH_01", "PHY_01"]
    },
    {
      "studentId": "string",
      "subjects": ["CHEM_01", "BIO_01"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Implementation Details
1. Security:
   - All endpoints require authentication
   - Only users with ADMIN role can access these endpoints
   - No confirmation needed for admin-created links

2. Validation:
   - All IDs must be valid and exist in the system
